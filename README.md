# Description: Practice with creating functions and regularly commiting changes.
# Method: The method I used consisted of locally testing my code. Once those tests passed, I committed my changes. Once all of my changes were committed, I retested everything again. Once those passed and I was sure that everything worked as I intended, I pushed to master.
